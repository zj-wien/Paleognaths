**#1. Identification of Z-linked sequences:**

We identified the Z chromosome sequences out of the draft genomes based on their alignments to the Z chromosome sequences of ostrich(Zhang, et al. 2015; Yazdi and Ellegren 2018), and also a female-specific reduction of read depth.

Scaffold sequences of each species were aligned with LASTZ(Harris 2007) (version 1.02.00) to the ostrich Z chromosome sequence with parameter set ‘--step=19 --hspthresh=2200 --inner=2000 --ydrop=3400 --gappedthresh=10000 --format=axt’ and a score matrix set for distant species comparison. 

Alignments were converted into a series of syntenic ‘chains’, ‘net’ and ‘maf’ results with different levels of alignment scores using UCSC Genome Browser’s utilities (http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/).

Based on the whole genome alignments, we first identified the best aligned scaffolds within the overlapping regions on the reference genome, according to their alignment scores with a cutoff of at least 50% of the whole scaffold length aligned in the LASTZ net results. We further estimated the overall identity and coverage distributions with a 10kb non-overlapped sliding window for each scaffold along the reference sequence, and obtained the distributions of identity and coverage. Scaffolds within the lower 5% region of each distribution were removed to avoid spurious alignments. 

Finally, scaffolds were ordered and oriented into pseudo-chromosome sequences according to their unique positions on the reference. Scaffolds were linked with 600 ‘N’s as a mark of separation. 


  
**#2. Identification of W-linked sequences:**

W-linked sequences are expected to also form an alignment with the reference Z chromosome of ostrich, but with lower numbers of aligned sequences and lower levels of sequence identity than their homologous Z-linked sequences, due to the accumulation of deleterious mutations after recombination was suppressed on the W. 

We also expect that there are still certain degrees (at least 70% as a cutoff) of sequence similarities between the Z- and W-linked sequences, for discriminating the true W-linked sequences from spurious alignments. After excluding the Z-linked sequences from the draft genome, we performed a second round of LASTZ alignment against the Z chromosome sequences of each species built from the above step. Then we excluded the spurious alignments with the cutoff of the pairwise sequence identity to be higher than 70%, but lower than 95%, and with the aligned sequences spanning at least 50% of the scaffold length. 

We further verified the W-linked sequences in species with sequencing data of both sexes available.
